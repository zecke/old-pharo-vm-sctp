	"The start of a PIC has a call to a run-time abort routine that either handles
	 a dispatch to an interpreted method or a dispatch of an MNU case.  The
	 routine selects the path depending on ClassReg; if zero it takes the MNU
	 path; if nonzero the dispatch to interpreter path.  Neither of these paths
	 returns. The abort routine must be called;  In the callee the PIC is located
	 by adding the relevant offset to the return address of the call."
