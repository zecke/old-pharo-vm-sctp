I am the code generator for the Cog VM.  My job is to produce machine code versions of methods for faster execution and to manage inline caches for faster send performance.  I can be tested in the current image using my class-side in-image compilation facilities.  e.g. try

	StackToRegisterMappingCogit genAndDis: (Integer >> #benchFib)

I have concrete subclasses that implement different levels of optimization:
	SimpleStackBasedCogit is the simplest code generator.

	StackToRegisterMappingCogit is the current production code generator  It defers pushing operands
	to the stack until necessary and implements a register-based calling convention for low-arity sends.

	StackToRegisterMappingCogit is an experimental code generator with support for counting
	conditional branches, intended to support adaptive optimization.
