I am an abstract instruction generated by the Cogit.  I am subsequently concretized to machine code for the current processor.  A sequence of concretized CogAbstractInstructions are concatenated to form the code for a CogMethod.  I am an abstract class.  My concrete subclasses concretize to the machine code of a specific processor.
