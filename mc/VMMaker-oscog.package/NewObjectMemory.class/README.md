I am a refinement of ObjectMemory that eliminates the need for pushRemappableOop:/popRemappableOop in the interpreter proper.  Certain primitives that do major allocation may still want to provoke a garbage collection and hence may still need to remap private pointers.  But the interpreter subclass of this class does not have to provided it reserves sufficient space for it to make progress to the next scavenge point (send or backward branch).
