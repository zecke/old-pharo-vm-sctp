callback support
enterSmalltalkExecutiveImplementation
	"Main entry-point into the interpreter at each execution level, where an execution
	 level is either the start of execution or reentry for a callback.  Capture the C stack
	 pointers so that calls from machine-code into the C run-time occur at this level.
	 This is the actual implementation, separated from enterSmalltalkExecutive so the
	 simulator can wrap it in an exception handler and hence simulate the setjmp/longjmp."
